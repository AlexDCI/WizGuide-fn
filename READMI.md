# WizGuide-FN

A simple Django project that interacts with OpenAI's API to provide translation services and explanations based on GPT-3.5-turbo.

This project allows users to select a source and target language, input text for translation, and get the translated text along with optional explanations for the translation. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to perform translations and provide additional context or comments about the translated content.

## Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create and activate a virtual environment for your project:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Add Your OpenAI API Key
Create a .env file in the project root (where manage.py is located) and add your OpenAI API key:

makefile
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
4. Apply Database Migrations
Run the database migrations to set up your database:

bash
python manage.py migrate


5. Run the Development Server
Start the development server to test the project locally:

bash
python manage.py runserver
Usage
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
You will see a form with options to select a source language, target language, and input the text for translation.
Once you fill out the form and click "Translate," the AI will provide a translation of the text into the target language.
Optionally, you can request explanations for the translation by entering a comment. This explanation will be generated by OpenAI and displayed on the page.
The translated text and explanation (if requested) will be shown below the form.
File Overview
requirements.txt: Contains the Python dependencies required for the project.
main/views.py: Handles the logic for interacting with OpenAI’s API for both translations and generating comments.
templates/main/translate.html: The frontend interface for selecting languages and inputting text.
.env: Stores your OpenAI API key (ensure this file is not committed to version control).
urls.py: Manages routing to the translation page.
Features
Translation: The user can select a source language and target language, input text, and get a translation from GPT-3.5-turbo.
Explanations: The user can optionally request an explanation of the translated text, which will be generated by GPT-3.5-turbo and displayed in the target language.
Dynamic Language Support: The supported languages are configurable in the HTML, and you can add more as needed.
Example
Source language: German
Target language: Russian
Text: "Jobcenter in Germany"
Translation: "Джобцентр в Германии"
Explanation (if requested): "Джобцентр — это организация в Германии, которая помогает безработным гражданам найти работу и предоставляет финансовую помощь."
Notes
Ensure that the .env file with your OpenAI API key is properly configured.
The translation service works best for commonly spoken languages, but you can extend language options as needed.
The comment_request feature is optional; you can request detailed explanations for the translation.
